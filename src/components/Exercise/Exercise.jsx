                  Deep breathing can help restore diaphragm function and
                  increase lung capacity. Deep breathing exercises can also
                  lessen feelings of anxiety and stress, which are common for
                  someone who experienced severe symptoms or was admitted to a
                  hospital.Anyone can benefit from deep breathing techniques,
                  but they play an especially important role in the COVID-19
                  recovery process.

                  containing a piston or ball. As you breathe in, the piston or
                  ball inside the column moves up. The height of the piston or
                  ball shows how much air you breathed in.Using an incentive

                  'Proning is a medically accepted position to improve breathing
                  comfort and oxygenation'It is beneficial in Covid-19 patients
                  with compromised breathing comfort, especially during home
                  isolation," it added. The prone positioning helps to improve
                  ventilation, makes breathing easy.Avoid proning for an hour after meals.
